MongoDB Replication Setup
On 12th of June 2025, we worked on setting up replication in MongoDB. Below are the steps we performed during the class:

1] Navigated to the MongoDB installation directory:

cd \
cd "Program Files"
cd MongoDB
cd Server
cd 8.0
cd bin
This allowed us to access the MongoDB server binaries needed to start the replica set instances.

2]  Created data directories for the replica set members:

cd \
mkdir data
cd data
mkdir db0
mkdir db1
mkdir db2
Here, we created separate directories (db0, db1, db2) to store data for each replica node.

3] Started three MongoDB instances as replica set members:

mongod --port 27017 --dbpath "C:\data\db0" --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip localhost
mongod --port 27018 --dbpath "C:\data\db1" --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip localhost
mongod --port 27019 --dbpath "C:\data\db2" --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip localhost
Each instance was started on a different port with rs0 as the replica set name.

4]  Connected to the primary MongoDB instance:

mongosh --port 27017
This connected us to the first node, from where we could configure the replica set.

5]  Initiated the replica set and added members:

rs.initiate({ 
  _id: "rs0", 
  members: [ 
    { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" }, 
    { _id: 1, host: "localhost:27018" }, 
    { _id: 2, host: "localhost:27019" } 
  ] 
})
This command initialized the replica set with three members.

6]  Checked the replica set status:

rs.status()
We used this command to verify that all members were added successfully and the replica set was working correctly.
